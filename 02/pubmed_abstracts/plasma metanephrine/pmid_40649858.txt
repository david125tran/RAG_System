The Perioperative Biochemical and Clinical Considerations of Pheochromocytoma Management.

Pheochromocytoma, a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor, poses significant perioperative challenges due to its potential for severe hemodynamic instability. Careful management of patients with pheochromocytoma is critical for patient safety and favorable outcomes. The diagnostic workup focuses on biochemical analysis of plasma or urinary metanephrines, followed by imaging for tumor localization and genetic testing to identify hereditary syndromes. Preoperative management emphasizes adequate alpha-adrenergic blockade followed by beta-blockade to stabilize cardiovascular function. Anesthetic planning requires meticulous attention to volume status, cardiovascular optimization, and intraoperative monitoring to mitigate the risks of hypertensive crises and hypotension. Postoperative care must account for ongoing hemodynamic and metabolic fluctuations. A multidisciplinary, protocol-driven approach is essential to improve outcomes in patients undergoing pheochromocytoma resection. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the genetic, biochemical, clinical, and anesthetic considerations involved in the diagnosis and perioperative management of pheochromocytoma.
