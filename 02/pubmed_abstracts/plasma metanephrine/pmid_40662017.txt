Evaluation of Serum Neudesin Levels in Patients With Adrenal Incidentaloma.

Neudesin is a neurotrophic factor involved in various metabolic and inflammatory pathways. However, its role in adrenal incidentalomas remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate serum neudesin levels in patients with adrenal incidentalomas and investigate their potential clinical significance. This is a single-center, cross-sectional, controlled study conducted in the Endocrinology Clinic of Izmir Tepecik Training and Research Hospital between July 2018 and August 2019. The study included 68 patients diagnosed with adrenal incidentaloma and a control group of 38 healthy individuals. Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S), total testosterone, plasma aldosterone, plasma renin activity, 24-hour urine metanephrine and normetanephrine levels, and neudesin levels were measured, and comorbidities were recorded. The patient group was significantly older and had a higher BMI than the control group ( Our findings suggest that serum neudesin levels may be associated with adrenal incidentalomas and related metabolic alterations. Further studies should investigate the potential diagnostic or prognostic value of neudesin in adrenal disorders.
