Pheochromocytoma in a Patient With Chronic Hypotension: A Case Report.

Pheochromocytomas are neuroendocrine tumors that commonly present with hypertension, headache, palpitations, perspiration, and facial flushing. The diagnosis is typically made with imaging demonstrating an adrenal mass and elevated metanephrines and normetanephrines. The recommended treatment is medical optimization and adrenalectomy. Here, we present the case of a patient referred to our surgical oncology clinic with diagnostic challenges due to chronic hypotension and only heart palpitations. She was found to have a peripherally located adrenal mass extending over the renal hilum with an otherwise normal adrenal gland. Elevated plasma and urine normetanephrines were found, so the patient underwent complete resection of the tumor with en bloc adrenalectomy and was ultimately found to have a pheochromocytoma.  After surgery, she has no evidence of disease and has had resolution of palpitations.
