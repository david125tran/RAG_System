A Rare Case Report of Extra-adrenal Pheochromocytoma Masquerading as a Pancreatic Head Malignancy.

Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors originating outside the adrenal glands and can pose significant diagnostic challenges due to their variable presentations. This report highlights a case of an extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma masquerading as a pancreatic head malignancy. We underscore the importance of considering extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic masses, particularly when biochemical or clinical features suggest catecholamine excess. Early recognition and appropriate management are crucial to avoid unnecessary interventions and improve patient outcomes.
