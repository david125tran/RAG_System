[Dilated cardiomyopathy complicating a pheochromocytoma with favorable evolution after surgery: about a case in Dakar 'case report and literature review'].

Dilated cardiomyopathy is a rare and often little-known complication of pheochromocytoma, it is likewise exceptionally its discovery circumstance. This is usually an acute, reversible cardiomyopathy.We report the case of a 20-year-old young adult hospitalized for hypokinetic dilated cardiomyopathy with severe impairment of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to 17%. High blood pressure persisted despite antihypertensive treatment, and the heart failure syndrome was refractory to medical treatment. Abdominal CT scan revealed a heterogeneous adrenal mass strongly suggestive of pheochromocytoma. Determination of plasma metanephrines and normetanephrines led to the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. After surgery, the course was marked by stabilization of blood pressure, normalization of Doppler echocardiography and complete clinical remission. He remained asymptomatic at one year.
