A Rare Case of Catecholamine-Secreting Adrenal Myelolipoma.

Adrenal myelolipoma (AML) is a rare, benign, asymptomatic, nonfunctioning tumor of the adrenal cortex detected incidentally. AML can be accompanied by several other endocrine disorders simultaneously. Here, we report a case of a 36-year-old female with primary hypothyroidism and metabolic syndrome accompanied by severe hypertension and pheochromocytoma. However, the histopathological examination of the excised adrenal gland confirmed myelolipoma. Following surgery, her plasma nor-metanephrine levels decreased to normal values and the patient became normotensive, which suggested that the mass was functioning.
